### Layered Architecture: 
Implementing a layered architecture makes a project modular and easier to maintain. The basic layers could be:
Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for managing the UI and UI logic.
Business layer: Also known as Service layer, it encapsulates all business logic.
Data access layer: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database or any other data store.
Each layer should only interact with its neighboring layers (e.g., Controllers should not be directly querying databases).

### Model-View-Controller (MVC): 
The MVC pattern can be used to separate concerns, where the Model corresponds to the data access layer, the View corresponds to the presentation layer, and the Controller acts as the intermediary handling the data flow between them.

### Route-Controller-Service-Model Pattern: 
In this pattern, Routes define URL routes, Controllers handle requests and responses, Services contain business logic, and Models define data structures and handle database interactions.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD): 
This approach focuses on the core business logic and aims to create a model of the problem domain that can then be used to guide the design of the software. This approach can be beneficial for complex systems.

### Microservices Architecture: 
This is recommended for larger, complex applications. Each microservice is a small application with its own specific business focus, which can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA): 
Node.js is inherently event-driven, which makes it a good fit for implementing EDA. This approach can help you design applications that are highly scalable and loosely coupled.
